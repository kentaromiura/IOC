IOC
===

This IOC plugin is just a rewrite of my really old vanilla js IOC container:
http://mykenta.blogspot.it/2007/09/kentaioc-js-ioc-library.html,
to understand what it does, and how it is supposed to work just look at the Spec.

In this repository I added a new kenta.injection.js which provides a Ninject style configuration (...well, sorta).


How to use
----------

Just include kenta.IOC.js.
look at the Spec directory to see a couple of example.
